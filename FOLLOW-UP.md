# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

### A) I used json-server with npx to serve flight.json to make it feel much like a data coming from server, I added axios to consume apis

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

### A) - npm i

### - npx json-server --port 3001 --watch public/flights.json (to serve flights data on port 3001 with proxy)

(Default) `npm start`

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

### To begin with, I will prefer using typescript with React, It will take relatively much time but it would ###take care of any leaks I might have skipped. The select button will work so that each flights data route to ###new page displaying full details of specific flights.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

### It was relatively easy, but i will say maybe because I didn't shy away from scss already boostrapped into code, normally I will use css.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

### Understanding the initial data structure and getting them to the final usable structure, It was a normal task.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

### It was nice, I thought it was simple but at midway I realized it might be testing for knowledge of data structures and algorithms and also giving attention to details.
